## How the Game Works
In this game you have a Player and Enemies (bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.

## Game Functionality


|  Functionality |
| ------ |
|The player can move left, right, up and down. |
| The enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board. |
|Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting square. |
|Once the player reaches the water ( the top of the game board), the game is won. |
| The game displays a life rating (from 1 to 5) that reflects the player's performance. At the beginning of a game, it display at least 5 stars. if the player collides with an enemy it should get down by 1. |
| When a the player collects 5 stars, wins the game, a modal appears to congratulate the player and ask if they want to play again. |
| A restart button allows the player to reset the game board. |
